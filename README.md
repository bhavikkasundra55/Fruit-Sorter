# Fruit-Sorter (Mango)

## Description

A Mango Sorting machine based on size, extent of spoilage and maturity of fruits using computer vision. Mango sorting system consists of automatic grading and sorting system. results of grading system used by sorting system. 

### Automatic grading 

Grading is classification of items based on certain features. traditional grading is done by trained people which is labor intensive, time consuming and inefficient. this is major reason for need of automatic grading. 

Grading is based on values of certain features: 
1. Size & Shape
2. Spoilage
3. Maturity (expressed by color and wrinkles)

### Automatic Sorting

Sorting is process of arranging mangoes systematically based on respective classes. 

## Implementation 

Automatic grading system is implemented using deep neural networks to classify mangoes in respective classes and generate required data used by sorting system to efficiently arrange mangoes.

### Architecture
